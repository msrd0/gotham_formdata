  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error<_>>`
          `&MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `&MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error<_>>`
          `&mut MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `&mut MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error<_>>`
  = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
