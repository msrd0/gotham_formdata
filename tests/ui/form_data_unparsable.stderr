  |          ^^^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `MyType` due to unsatisfied trait bounds

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error>`
          `&MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `&MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error>`
          `&mut MyType: FromStr`
          which is required by `&mut MyType: gotham_formdata::conversion::ConvertFromStr<gotham_formdata::Error>`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `FormData` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
